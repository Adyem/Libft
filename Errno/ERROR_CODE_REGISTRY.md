# Libft Error Code Registry

This registry enumerates every error code defined in [`Errno/errno.hpp`](errno.hpp) and summarizes the modules that are expected to set each value. All codes are relative to `ERRNO_OFFSET` (2000) when mirroring `errno` symbols. Helpers must restore `FT_ERR_SUCCESSS` after success paths to avoid leaking stale failures.

## Usage guidance

* When adding new error codes, update this registry and provide guidance on the modules that surface the value.
* Modules should document code-specific remediation steps in their README entries and keep error propagation consistent with this table.
* Tests should exercise both success and failure paths to ensure error codes are pushed and cleared as described here.
