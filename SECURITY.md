# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
We take the security of Libft seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please email security@libft.dev with the following details:

- A description of the issue and the affected modules.
- Steps to reproduce or a proof of concept that demonstrates the impact.
- Any known mitigations or suggested fixes.

Please avoid filing public issues for security problems so we have time to investigate and release a fix. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days.

## Disclosure Process
After confirming a vulnerability, we aim to provide a fix and coordinate a release within 30 days. We will keep you informed of progress and request your approval before publishing your name in acknowledgements. If the issue requires more time, we will share an updated timeline as soon as possible.

## Security Updates
Security fixes are backported to the latest minor release when feasible. Once an update is available, we will announce it in the release notes and through the project communication channels documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Preferred Languages
We prefer reports in English but will make a best effort to accommodate other languages using translation tools.
