# Encryption

## Security Rationale

`be_getEncryptionKey` reads entropy from the operating system to avoid
predictable keys. On Unix systems the function pulls random bytes from
`/dev/urandom`; on Windows it uses `CryptGenRandom`. If these sources are
unavailable, it falls back to `ft_random_seed` to preserve variability.
Mapping bytes to alphabetic characters maintains compatibility with the
existing interface while ensuring keys differ across runs.
