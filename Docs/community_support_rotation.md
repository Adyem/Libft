# Community Support Rotation

## Purpose
To ensure community questions receive timely responses, the Libft maintainers host recurring office hours and maintain a triage
rotation that assigns on-call coverage for forums, issue trackers, and chat channels.

## Office Hours
- **Schedule**: Every Tuesday and Thursday at 18:00 UTC via the community discussion forum's live session space.
- **Hosts**: The release manager coordinates attendance and invites subject matter experts based on the week's topics.
- **Format**:
  1. 10-minute release and roadmap update.
  2. 30-minute open Q&A addressing forum and issue tracker questions submitted in advance.
  3. 15-minute deep dive on a recently merged feature or upcoming initiative.
- **Documentation**: Notes and action items are published within 24 hours in the `Docs/community_discussion_forum.md` log.

## Triage Rotation
- **Cadence**: Weekly rotation running Monday 00:00 UTC through Sunday 23:59 UTC.
- **Coverage Areas**:
  - GitHub issues and pull requests tagged `needs-triage`.
  - Discussion forum threads awaiting staff response for more than 24 hours.
  - Real-time chat channels (#support and #security) for escalations.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Acknowledge new reports within 24 hours.
  - Categorize issues (bug, feature request, question) and ensure they have complete reproduction details.
  - Escalate security-sensitive findings to the security working group immediately.
  - Update the status board at the end of each shift with resolved and outstanding items.

## Staffing Roster
| Week | Primary Maintainer | Backup Maintainer |
|------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Week 1 (odd weeks) | Alice T. | Bruno L. |
| Week 2 (even weeks) | Carmen R. | Diego P. |

## Reporting
- A summary of triage activity is added to the monthly changelog.
- Trends and follow-up actions are reviewed during the first office hours session of each month.

## Continuous Improvement
- Collect feedback from community participants once per quarter to refine the format.
- Track average response time and backlog size to ensure the program meets the published service level objectives.
- Rotate backups into the primary slot every quarter to distribute knowledge evenly across the team.
