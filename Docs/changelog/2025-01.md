# January 2025 Update

## Highlights
- **Encryption module hardening.** Secure memory wiping helpers, key generation utilities, and
  vector-based regression coverage landed to protect caller buffers and validate algorithm outputs.
- **High-resolution timing.** New cross-platform shims expose nanosecond-precision time points with
  documentation that clarifies platform caveats.
- **Threading reliability.** Mutex ownership tracking fixes resolved the lingering hang in the
  configuration flag parser stress test.

## Quality and operations
- The full regression suite now exercises secure wipe, key management, and timing helpers, and the
  CI matrix records multi-run stress logs to document long-term stability.
- Encryption vector tests cover SHA-1, SHA-256, and HMAC-SHA-256 digests, catching expectation drift
  during future refactors.

## Community
- Added guidance on generating secure service keys and hardening deployed utilities.
- Upcoming focus areas include CMA guard instrumentation and expanding the compression codec roster;
  contributors interested in these tracks can coordinate via the maintainer chat.
