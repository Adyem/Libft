# Dependency Audit History

This directory stores timestamped reports generated by `tools/run_dependency_audits.sh`. Each run appends a new Markdown file
containing:

- The command invocation and environment metadata.
- A table summarizing audit results per ecosystem.
- Follow-up remediation tasks when vulnerabilities are detected.

Keeping historical artifacts helps us demonstrate continuous monitoring and track remediation timelines for compliance reviews.
